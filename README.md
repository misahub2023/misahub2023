## MISAHUB (Medical Imaging and Signal Analysis Hub)

**MISAHUB** stands for **Medical Imaging and Signal Analysis Hub**. A virtual, open-source platform which showcased cutting-edge research by a team of talented students, faculty members, and healthcare professionals. MISAHUB provided unique opportunities to work in the field of artificial intelligence in healthcare for good, facilitating collaboration and innovation for undergraudate and graduate students of diverse backgrounds, currently on a mentor-mentee concept. We believed in training the new generation of students from sciences, engineering and medicine to tackle interesting biomedical problems primarily in EEG, colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy, ultrasound imaging, GI endoscopy, hysteroscopy, and now dental imaging. 

### Background
MISAHUB was founded in 2019, online from 2022, and  was led by **Dr. Palak Handa** from the *Research Center for Medical Image Analysis and Artificial Intelligence (MIAAI), Department of Medicine, Danube Private University, Krems, Austria*, and **Prof. Dr. Nidhi Goel** from the *Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, Delhi, India*. The group has mentored more **150 students** since 2019 from institutions including:

- Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW), New Delhi
- University School of Automation and Robotics (USAR), New Delhi
- Delhi Technological University (DTU), New Delhi
- Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai
- Sanghvi College of Enginereing, Mumbai
- IIT Delhi, IIT Indore, IIIT Delhi
- Grace Hopper Celeberations, GirlScript, Women Tech Council, and Trussia College

MISAHUB was functional from 2019 to 2024 and no longer takes new mentees. All the projects, code files, and datasets are available here for resource and further use in research. 

### Achievements
- Published more than **12 journal articles in SCIE indexed journals**
- Filed **10 national patents in granting and publishing stage**
- Organized and successfully completed **4 biomedical challenges with Internatinal Organization and conferences like IEEE ICIP 2024, CVIP 2023, CVIP 2024, IEEE Delhi Section, MIAAI, DPU, Austria**
- Presented more than **20 conference papers of national and international repute**
- Released more than **10 biomedical datasets in Video Capsule Endoscopy, EEG, Colonoscopy, and Ultrasound Imaging which have more than 1000 downloads in less than an year.**
- Mentee success stories and placements in Google, Micosoft, Adobe, Walmart, etc.
- Comprehensive guidance in writing research papers, ways to research and personal development.
